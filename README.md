MonitoringSystem is a backend-focused distributed system built in .NET (C#) to demonstrate background processing, failure handling, and end-to-end observability. It consists of an ASP.NET Web API as the single source of truth and a separate OrderWorker (BackgroundService) that simulates real workloads by calling internal API endpoints over HTTP, enabling clear fault attribution and retry behavior. The system models order lifecycles with configurable retries persisted in PostgreSQL using Dapper, exposes read-only metrics endpoints for monitoring, and is instrumented with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger for full distributed tracing across Worker → API → Database. The architecture enforces clean boundaries via a shared contracts library, avoids cross-process coupling, and prioritizes production-style observability over UI.
